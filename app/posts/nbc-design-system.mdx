## Challenge

When I joined National Bank of Canada, some UI guidelines were in place, but adoption was low due to outdated components, lack of documentation, and inconsistent implementation. Replacing the UI entirely was not an option, so we had to find a way to modernize the front-end while maintaining stability and security.

## Approach

I led a strategic transformation, collaboratively creating a new codebase that would progressively replace our legacy front-end code. By partnering across disciplines and starting with fundamental components like buttons and headings, we minimized disruption and established a solid foundation for future innovation.

As our cross-functional team embraced the initiative, we expanded the system's scope, building comprehensive documentation and fostering a culture of shared ownership. Through inclusive training sessions and open contributions, we carefully evolved our design ecosystem, ensuring that both designers and developers felt empowered to shape our technical and visual standards.

## Results

The design system initiative sparked a transformative shift, dramatically improving UI consistency and reducing lead times across projects. By creating a shared design language, we bridged critical gaps between designers and developers, fostering deeper mutual understanding of UX and technical considerations. What began as a small, focused effort has since grown into a dedicated team driving sustainable innovation across hundreds of team members and multiple platforms.

## Lessons

This was one of the most rewarding projects of my career. Leading a change of this scaleâ€”both in technology and team dynamicsâ€”was complex but incredibly fulfilling. One key factor in our success was strong executive support, which allowed us to focus on gradual replacement rather than an all-at-once overhaul. Showcasing progress and gathering testimonials along the way helped solidify buy-in at every level.

This experience shaped how I approach design systems: not just as a set of UI components, but as a strategic tool that aligns teams, improves workflows, and fosters collaboration. ðŸš€
