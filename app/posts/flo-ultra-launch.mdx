## Challenge

Introducing the FLO Ultra—our first 320kW fast charger—required an innovative approach to demonstrate its groundbreaking features. At Distributech in San Diego, we faced the task of showcasing a next-generation EV charging solution that would stand out in a competitive technological landscape. The goal was to translate years of development into a compelling, interactive experience.

## Approach

I developed a web-based prototype that transformed our demo unit into an interactive platform. By integrating controls for the charger's advanced features—including dynamic lighting, audio feedback, and motorized cable management—we created more than just a display. The prototype became a powerful tool for both presentation and design refinement. With a VinFast vehicle on-site, we offered convention attendees a tangible glimpse into the future of electric vehicle charging.

## Results

The interactive demonstration at Distributech generated significant excitement around the FLO Ultra. Convention attendees were the first to experience our innovative charger, getting hands-on with technology that represents a significant leap forward in EV charging infrastructure. The prototype not only highlighted our technological capabilities but also positioned FLO as a forward-thinking leader in the electric vehicle charging market.

## Lessons

Developing this interactive prototype revealed the power of experiential technology demonstrations. What began as a marketing tool evolved into a critical platform for design iteration and user experience testing. The project reinforced the importance of creating technology that isn't just functional, but truly engaging. I feel fortunate to have been part of a team that pushes the boundaries of innovation in electric vehicle charging.
